  <h3>Our Story</h3>
</div>

<div class="about-story" >
  <p>
    Our journey began in the wake of the global pandemic, a time that pushed many to rethink their paths. After over two decades of working as a supervisor and manager at a leading water body construction company in the industry — our founder decided it was time to build something of his own. With over 25+ years of experience, including managing international Water Body projects and overseeing constructions across major Indian cities, he took a leap of faith in 2020 and established his own Water Body—Design, Construction and Maintenance company.

  <p>
    What sets us apart is our priority to trust and perfection. We bring a deep commitment to precision, client satisfaction, and timely project delivery. Every site is personally overseen to ensure the highest standards and error-free execution. We believe in quality over profit—working with transparency, integrity, and a deep respect for our client’s vision.
  </p>
  <p>
    Today, SAN Engineerings stands as a symbol of trust and reliability. We take pride in our journey, our people, and the partnerships we’ve built along the way. As we look to the future, we remain dedicated to pushing boundaries and shaping a better tomorrow.
